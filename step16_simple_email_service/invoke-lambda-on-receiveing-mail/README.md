# Calling Lambda When Receiveing Emails On Verified Domain

## Notes

- Currently AWS is supporting email receiving support in three regions us-east-1, us-west-2 and eu-west-1.
- We should have our own domain.
- Domain should be verified on Amazon SES.
- We should have atleast one rule define to receive email on given verified email addresses.
